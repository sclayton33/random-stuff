# RandomStuff
Just a collection of random scripts.

Anything here was done for my own practice or use.

Contents:

- Calculator.py - A basic calculator with a GUI implemented by Tkinter.
- MonteCarloPi.py - Estimates the value of pi using a Monte Carlo simulation. Displays a window to visualize the process.
- Multi-Clipboard.pyw - A basic multi-clipboard application that allows saving of clipboard contents to a specified keyword for later recall. Written in Python.
- SendEmail.py - A python script to send a random image via email.
- Rename_TV_Seasons.py - Python script to rename the season portion of filenames for TV shows. E.g. 'S01' to 'S02'. Pretty specific usecase but it can be adapted to something more general.
